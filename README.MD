# MapTrak

A web application made using both Wix Developer Website and ArcGIS API. Aims to display local crime data, disease outbreak, and local political events. <br>
Frontend built using HTML, we experimented with the backend using Flask, Python, and then ended up using JS. <br>

User can also text a Twilio number a keyword, like "earthquake," and our app uses the Twitter API to geolocate the most recent tweets about that keyword. It uses Twilio's API to send these locations back to the user.
